# Environment Setup [`⇧`](#contents)

1. First and foremost, please see the suggested IDE extensions in the dropdown below to make sure that your editor is set up properly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <details><summary><strong>Suggested IDE extensions</strong></summary>
>
> <p>
>
> VS Code
>
> - [bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
> - [esbenp.prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

> - [Vue.volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
>
> WebStorm
>
> - Check out the [Vue.js development docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/vue-js.html)
> - Make sure a [local Node.js interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/developing-node-js-applications.html#ws_node_configure_local_node_interpreter) is configured in your project
> - Make sure the [Vue.js plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/tree/master/vuejs) and [JavaScript Debugger](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/configuring-javascript-debugger.html) are enabled in the plugins page of the settings

> </p>
> </details>

2. To setup your development environment, first install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Docker, as an alternative Scribe recommends installing [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). Docker Desktop comes with many Docker tools and a straightforward user interface.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [scri.be repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/scri.be.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) 🔑
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/scri.be.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd scri.be
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (scri.be repository)

4. Create a virtual environment for the developer tools, activate it and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Unix or MacOS:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # After activating venv:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

5. Start your docker images with the following:

   ```bash
   # --build only necessary with new dependencies or backend model changes
   docker compose --env-file .env.dev up --build

   # And to stop the containers when you're done working:
   # docker compose --env-file .env.dev down
   ```

6. You can visit <http://localhost:3000/> to see the development frontend once the container is up and running.

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [General room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!yQJjLmluvlkWttNhKo:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

7. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that each of your commits is properly checked against our linter and formatters:

   ```bash
   # In the project root:
   pre-commit install
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> pre-commit is Python package that can be installed via pip or any other Python package manager. You can also find it in our [requirements.txt](backend/requirements.txt) file.
>
> ```bash
> pip install pre-commit
> ```
