## Scribe's community portal scri.be

**scri.be** is the landing page of the Scribe organization. Its purpose is to present Scribe's projects and provide resources for those who want to learn more about app functionality as well as join the community.

> [!NOTE]
> The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested, with the articles and presentations in [featured by](#featured-by) also being good resources for learning more about Scribe.

Scribe apps are available on [iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) (WIP) and [Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) (WIP). For the data formatting processes see [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) and for our data server see [Scribe-Server](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server).

# Environment Setup [`‚áß`](#contents)

1. First and foremost, please see the suggested IDE extensions in the dropdown below to make sure that your editor is set up properly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <details><summary><strong>Suggested IDE extensions</strong></summary>
>
> <p>
>
> VS Code
>
> - [bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
> - [esbenp.prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

> - [Vue.volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
>
> WebStorm
>
> - Check out the [Vue.js development docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/vue-js.html)
> - Make sure a [local Node.js interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/developing-node-js-applications.html#ws_node_configure_local_node_interpreter) is configured in your project
> - Make sure the [Vue.js plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/tree/master/vuejs) and [JavaScript Debugger](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/configuring-javascript-debugger.html) are enabled in the plugins page of the settings

> </p>
> </details>

2. To setup your development environment, first install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Docker, as an alternative Scribe recommends installing [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). Docker Desktop comes with many Docker tools and a straightforward user interface.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [scri.be repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/scri.be.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) üîë
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/scri.be.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd scri.be
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/scri.be.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (scri.be repository)

4. Create a virtual environment for the developer tools, activate it and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Unix or MacOS:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # After activating venv:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

5. Start your docker images with the following:

   ```bash
   # --build only necessary with new dependencies or backend model changes
   docker compose --env-file .env.dev up --build

   # And to stop the containers when you're done working:
   # docker compose --env-file .env.dev down
   ```

6. You can visit <http://localhost:3000/> to see the development frontend once the container is up and running.

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [General room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!yQJjLmluvlkWttNhKo:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

7. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that each of your commits is properly checked against our linter and formatters:

   ```bash
   # In the project root:
   pre-commit install
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> pre-commit is Python package that can be installed via pip or any other Python package manager. You can also find it in our [requirements.txt](backend/requirements.txt) file.
>
> ```bash
> pip install pre-commit
> ```
